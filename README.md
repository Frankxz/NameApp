**SwiftUI** 

**Training app** 

Simple Dual Screen Application. It does not make any sense, it is only for learning SwiftUI posibilities 

First screen for login with name. Here is a character counter, if the name is less than 3 characters the button is not enabled.
 
Second screen with welcome label, timer, timer start button and logout button. \
When you press the start button, the timer starts. \
While the timer value is being updated, the screen is also updated and displays the current timer value. \
Upon completion of the timer, it can be reset. 

Thanks to AppStorage, when re-launching the application, the user does not have to re-enter his name if he is already logged in
